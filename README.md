## My Role

In the project my official role was R&D, however my job was mainly to fix and extend the systems made by others.
More specifically:
- Added coins to the level generation
- Collected all animations from mixamo, and implemented them
- Adjusted the custom vertex shader to allow for texture sampling
- Fixed core gameplay bugs
- Etc.
